# Boundary regularity of the Perron solution and the harmonic potential of a ring

The Perron envelope is harmonic (`perronEnvelope_harmonicOn`); this file supplies its **boundary
behaviour** and assembles the **harmonic potential of a ring domain**.

A boundary point `ζ` of `U` is *regular* when it carries a **barrier**: a subharmonic function on
`U`, continuous up to the closure, vanishing exactly at `ζ` and strictly negative elsewhere on the
closure. At a regular point where the boundary data `φ` is continuous, the Perron envelope attains
`φ ζ` as a limit from inside `U` (the classical barrier sandwich). When every frontier point is
regular and the frontier splits into two closed pieces `E` (inner) and `F` (outer), the Perron
envelope of the data `0` on `E`, `1` on `F` is the **harmonic potential** `u` of the ring: harmonic
on `U`, continuous up to the closure, `0` on `E` and `1` on `F`.

The potential is the bridge to the conformal modulus and conjugate-modulus reciprocity: its gradient
is the extremal metric of the connecting family, and its boundary flux is the modulus.

## Main definitions

* `IsBarrier β U ζ` — `β` is a barrier for `U` at the boundary point `ζ`;
* `IsRegularBoundary U` — every frontier point of `U` carries a barrier.

## Main statements

* `perronEnvelope_tendsto_of_barrier` — at a barrier point where `φ` is continuous, the Perron
  envelope tends to `φ ζ`;
* `exists_ringPotential` — the harmonic potential of a regular ring domain (`0` on `E`, `1` on `F`).

/-- A **barrier** for the open set `U` at a frontier point `ζ`: a subharmonic function on `U`,
continuous up to the closure, vanishing at `ζ` and strictly negative everywhere else on the closure.
Its existence makes `ζ` a regular boundary point for the Dirichlet problem. -/

/-- **Boundary attainment of the Perron solution at a barrier point.** If `U` is bounded open with a
barrier at the frontier point `ζ`, the boundary data `φ` is bounded above on the frontier and
continuous at `ζ` within the frontier, and the Perron family is nonempty, then the Perron envelope
converges to `φ ζ` as `z → ζ` from inside `U`. (Classical barrier sandwich: for `ε > 0`, a multiple
of the barrier squeezes the envelope between `φ ζ ± ε` near `ζ`.) -/
