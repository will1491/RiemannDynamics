# Conformal transfer of harmonicity and subharmonicity

Plane-level bricks for Perron theory on Riemann surfaces: harmonicity and
subharmonicity are invariant under holomorphic changes of variable, so the
chart-local definitions on a surface are independent of the chart. This file
proves the invariance on `ℂ` together with the classical local facts that the
surface theory consumes:

* `harmonicAt_comp_analyticAt` — a harmonic function precomposed with a
  holomorphic map is harmonic;
* `SubharmonicOn.le_of_harmonic_majorant` — the harmonic-majorant bound on any
  bounded subdomain;
* `subharmonicOn_comp_biholo` — subharmonicity transfers along a biholomorphic
  change of variable;
* `exists_harmonicOnNhd_of_bounded_punctured` — a bounded harmonic function on
  a punctured disc extends harmonically across the puncture;
* `harnack_inequality_ball` — the two-sided Harnack inequality on concentric
  balls;
* `SubharmonicOn.eventually_eq_of_le` — the strong maximum principle: a
  subharmonic function is locally constant at an interior maximum.
